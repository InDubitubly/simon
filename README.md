### Notes on Node.js and Express
It works, although I don't understand it all. But just like JavaScript, I'm sure using it a bunch and applying it to my startup will help. I like being able to understand how this is hosted, on my own computer or on my server. I'm grateful for the OpenJS group that makes this free and easy to use.
It's hard to know exactly what kinds of data I'm working with, but it seems I can worry less about that and still get it done. Not knowing what the req and res parameters will be or how that really interacts (yes they're JSON but still) doesn't make it impossible to write this code and host a server. Just remember the code and parameters you are sending are in the req body, and using functions on the res parameter helps you 'send back' different files, or direct the page to them.
